      <h2>Chicken</h2>
      <p>Just like the food we eat, our list ends in the digestive system. The proteins, vitamins, minerals and the low content of saturated fat all contribute to a healthy stomach. And this, as you surely know, provides well-being. However, keep in mind that meat does not contain dietary fiber, which is also important for digestion. But then it’s fortunate that chicken can be served in many different dishes, in good company with many other healthy and fiber-based ingredients!</p>

      <p>If your primary meat source comes predominantly from a drive-thru, then yes, these arguments probably hold true. But there’s a world of difference between mass-produced meat from large agricultural operations, and pasture-raised meat from small-scale farms. The animals’ diet and living conditions have a profound effect on what the meat does for your body and for (or against) the planet.</p>

      <h2>Sushi</h2>
      <p>While any foods may be plated artistically, sushi is a true work of art. Usually made by trained chefs, each item is simple, yet refined, and some chefs take great pride in their presentation, making beautiful rolls, decorative garnishes, and incorporating items that compliment the food’s look and taste. Good sushi restaurants also will concentrate on a pleasant atmosphere in which to dine, and walking into a new world.creating an artful atmosphere.</p>
